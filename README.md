# Chess-2

This is an implamentation with the godot engine of this video - 

[![Video where someone made a better version of chess called chess 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mcivL8u176Y/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcivL8u176Y)

you can find a working version of this on itch.io - https://jacb.itch.io/chess-2-based-on-oats-jenkins


Hopefully comming soon - 
  - A way to select a position in the jail
  - Ai to play against. Almost surely using a MinMax algorithm.
